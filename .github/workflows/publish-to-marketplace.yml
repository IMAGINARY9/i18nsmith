name: Publish VS Code extension to Marketplace

# This workflow publishes the `packages/vscode-extension` package to the
# Visual Studio Marketplace when a GitHub Release is published.
#
# Requirements:
# - Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the `All accessible accounts` scope
#   for VSCE publishing and add it to repository secrets as `VSCE_TOKEN`.
# - The `publisher` field in `packages/vscode-extension/package.json` must match
#   the Marketplace publisher id you control.
