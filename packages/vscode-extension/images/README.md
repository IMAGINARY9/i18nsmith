This folder should contain the extension icon used for Marketplace listing.

Please add a 128x128 PNG named `icon.png` here before publishing the extension to the Visual Studio Marketplace.

Example path: `packages/vscode-extension/images/icon.png`

Notes:
- Marketplace expects a PNG image. SVG may work locally, but for publishing use PNG.
- Keep file size small (under ~100KB) for faster gallery load times.
