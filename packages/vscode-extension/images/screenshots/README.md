Add screenshots here to use for Marketplace listing and README previews.

Recommended:
- `screenshot-1.png` — main feature (Diagnostics + hover)
- `screenshot-2.png` — Quick Actions / CodeLens
- `screenshot-3.png` — Transform preview / diff

Place images at `packages/vscode-extension/images/screenshots/` and reference them in the README when ready.
